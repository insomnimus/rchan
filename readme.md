# fourchan

This library is a [4chan JSON API][] wrapper.

# Features

-	All methods are async.
-	The JSON objects are normalized (and made sane!) so you don't have to deal with questionable API design.
-	Lightweight, only dependencies are [reqwest][], [serde] and [serde_json][].

# Status

Work in progress.
